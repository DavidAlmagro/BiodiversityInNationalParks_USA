# Biodiversity in National Parks of the USA
## Introduction
This project aims to analyze biodiversity within four prominent national parks in the United States: Bryce Canyon, Great Smoky Mountains, Yellowstone, and Yosemite. Using Python, we will explore species observations, conservation statuses, and their ecological implications.

### Key Features:
#### Data Analysis:
Examine species diversity, abundance, and trends across parks.
#### Visualization:
Create informative visualizations to represent findings clearly and effectively.
#### Insights:
Provide insights into conservation efforts and species protection needs.

### Datasets Used:
- observations.csv: Contains species observation data, including scientific names, park names, and observation counts.
- species.info.csv: Includes species information such as category, common names, and conservation status.

### Technologies Used:
Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, etc.)
Join me in uncovering the rich biodiversity of America's national parks!


## Project Scope: Biodiversity in National Parks of the USA

The analysis will address the following key questions:

### 1. Species Observations
- **Most Observed Species**: Identify the species that are most frequently observed in each park to understand which are better adapted to these environments.
- **Variability Across Parks**: Compare species observations across the four parks to reveal significant patterns and differences in biodiversity.
- **Temporal Trends**: Analyze historical observation data to determine trends over time, including whether certain species sightings are increasing or decreasing.

### 2. Species Information
- **Species Distribution by Category**: Examine the distribution of species across categories (Amphibian, Bird, etc.) to understand which groups are most represented in each park.
- **Conservation Status**: Identify species with endangered statuses and assess how these species are distributed across the parks, providing insight into conservation needs.
- **Endemic and Rare Species**: Determine which species are endemic or rare in each park to identify priority candidates for conservation efforts.

### 3. Relationships Between Data
- **Correlation Analysis**: Investigate potential correlations between conservation status and observation frequency, assessing whether endangered species are observed less frequently than non-threatened species.

### Deliverables
The project will culminate in a comprehensive report featuring data analysis, visualizations, and actionable insights regarding biodiversity conservation in national parks.

## Project Stages

This project will be carried out in several stages to ensure a comprehensive analysis of biodiversity in national parks. The stages are as follows:

1. **Data Acquisition**
   - **Obtain Data**: Download relevant biodiversity and species observation data from reputable sources. Ensure the datasets cover the same parks and comparable time periods.
   
2. **Data Preparation**
   - **Load Data**: Use Pandas to load the data into DataFrames for analysis.
   - **Clean Data**: Handle missing values, remove duplicates, and ensure consistency across datasets.
   
3. **Data Exploration**
   - **Summary Statistics**: Generate summary statistics to understand the basic characteristics of species observations.
   - **Correlation Analysis**: Compute correlations between different variables, such as species observations and conservation status.
   
4. **Data Visualization**
   - **Visualize Relationships**: Use Seaborn and Matplotlib to create scatter plots, bar charts, and other visualizations to depict relationships between species observations and their ecological context.
   - **Enhance Visualizations**: Add titles, labels, and legends to make the plots informative and easy to understand.
   
5. **Hypothesis Testing**
   - **Form Hypotheses**: Develop hypotheses regarding relationships between species data and conservation status.
   - **Test Hypotheses**: Use appropriate statistical tests to validate or refute your hypotheses.
   
6. **Analysis and Interpretation**
   - **Interpret Results**: Analyze the findings from visualizations and statistical tests to draw meaningful conclusions about biodiversity.
   - **Summarize Findings**: Write a summary of your insights and their implications for conservation efforts.
   
7. **Documentation and Presentation**
   - **Create GitHub Repository**: Set up a repository to store your code, visualizations, and a README file that explains the project and its objectives.
